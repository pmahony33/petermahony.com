      <div class="explanation">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a site that allows you to compare the front page of the Wallstreet Journal and the New York Times from today and yesterday and a compilation of newsworthy dates.  The aim of this site is to compare two of the most influential newspapers in the United States, under the lens that all pieces reveal the natural bias of the author or editor. I challenge the viewer to notice and compare between the papers which stories are mentioned on the front page, what the headline reads, the location of the story on the page, which stories include images, and the sizes of the images.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wallstreet Journal is generally considered to be more conservative while New York Times is generally considered to be more liberal, which relates to the NYT on the left with a blue background and the WSJ on the right with a red background.<br>
      <br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I attempted to divorce this site from my own political bias by using basic CSS with neutral colors. This is not meant to be my own commentary on print media but instead I invite you to find your own position. </div>
